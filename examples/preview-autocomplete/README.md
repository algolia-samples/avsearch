# A/V Search Autocomplete with Preview

This front end is modeled after the Algolia documentation search as detailed in [this blog post](https://www.algolia.com/blog/ux/replicating-the-algolia-documentation-search-with-autocomplete/).

This is a cmd-K style search bar that includes query suggestions, click event capture,  and a preview panel. You can navigate the front end using either the keyboard or mouse. Clicking an entry will open the YouTube video at the exact point in the session where the results were found.

To run locally:

`npm run dev`

You can find a running demo here:
